# Nonlinear-Filtering
Filtering is the problem of estimating the state of a dynamical system given noisy measurements. Bayesian nonlinear filters use the Bayes theorem to obtain the posterior probability density function (PDF) of the state conditioned on the measurements. Nonlinear filtering in particular refers to the subfield wherein the focus is on nonlinear dynamical systems/nonlinear measurement functions. It also tries to get rid of Gaussianity assumptions in uncertainties. This repository will include functions for filtering nonlinear dynamical systems.
